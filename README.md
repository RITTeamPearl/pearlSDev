# About
This is the Senior Development Project by Pearl Team. Started in Spring Semester 2018 on the Rochester Riverside Convention Center project. The objective of this project is to create a mobile web service for the RRCC employees to get notifications, surveys, documents, etc.

# How to use the project
Insert instructions once the environment is set up.


# RRCC Server access
    Head to: https://67.97.247.13:4433 and click through the security warning (This doesn't matter at the moment, you're just downloading our SSL VPN application)
    
    Log in with the following credentials:

    username:  rit2

    password:  Win4RIT2018

    You will find a link to download Net Extender for Windows.  Download and install that.

    Once this is installed, launch the application and fill out the settings like so (Case matters):

    Server: 67.97.247.13:4433

    username:  rit2

    password:  Win4RIT2018

    domain:  RRCC

    Then click connect.  Once connected, you can Launch RDP and connect to 10.0.0.238 (This is RRCC-WEB02/3, the webserver Iâ€™ve created for this application)

    You can log in with the same credentials as above (Add the domain to it:  riverside) ( riverside\rit / Win4RIT2018 )

    When you are done with your session, please be sure to DISCONNECT the net extender program.
